# Introduction to the Endangered Archives Programme and Auto-Cataloguing

- An introduction to the EAP generally, and to the idea of ‘auto-cataloguing’ that seems like it might be valuable. As an example: records of the Circuit Court of Istmina, Chocó (EAP1477).
- Although EAP description standards do exist, our experience with Catalogación enabled us to grasp a problem that plagues many post-custodial digitization projects. Often, the metadata is inadequate for researchers who want to get more quickly to material relevant for their specific projects.
